# Koala

A medical imaging and report search system.

---

Koala is a full-stack application for searching and organizing medical studies and reports. It leverages a Go backend and a modern Vite/React frontend, integrates FHIR and DICOMweb standards, and is powered by Elasticsearch for efficient querying.

## üåü Features

- üîç Search functionality for report content, modality, date range, patient details, and clinical categories
- üí° Autocomplete support for faster and more accurate query entry
- üìÑ Integration of FHIR DiagnosticReports with DICOMweb ImagingStudies
- ‚öôÔ∏è Go backend providing structured APIs for search and data access
- üñ•Ô∏è Frontend built with Vite, React, and TailwindCSS for responsive user interfaces
- üê≥ Docker-ready build process for containerized deployment

## üì¶ How to Build

### Build from Source

For users who prefer to build and host Koala manually without Docker:

#### Frontend

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build
```

This will generate static assets in the `web/dist` directory.

#### Backend

The backend requires the built frontend assets to compile successfully. Ensure you have the frontend built before proceeding.

```bash
go build -o koala cmd/koala/main.go
```

The compiled binary `koala` will be available in the project root.

### Docker Build

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t koala .
```

This will create a Docker image named `koala`. You can run it with:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v "./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml" koala
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a config.yaml file in your project root for custom configurations. See the [`config/default.yaml`](config/default.yaml) for example configurations.

> **Note**: The `.env` file in `/web` is only used during frontend development to configure the Vite dev server. It does not affect backend configuration.
